# Day 01:
Learned GitHub basics and explored repositories.
# Day 02:
Downloaded and installed VirtualBox, Kali Linux (VirtualBox version), and 7-Zip to extract files.
Started Kali Linux using the VM file and logged in with default credentials (username: kali, password: kali).
# Day 03: 
Today we explored some common tools in Kali Linux like Nmap, Wireshark, Metasploit, Burp Suite, and John the Ripper. Nmap is used for scanning networks and identifying open ports and services. Wireshark helps in capturing and analyzing network traffic in real time. Metasploit is used to find and exploit vulnerabilities in systems. Burp Suite is mainly used for testing web applications and finding security flaws. John the Ripper is a password-cracking tool used to test password strength.
EXE stands for Executable file. It is a file format used in Windows to run programs. When you double-click a .exe file, it starts executing the instructions in the file, like installing or opening a software.

IPv4 vs IPv6
IPv4 uses a 32-bit address, whereas IPv6 uses a 128-bit address.
An example of an IPv4 address is: 192.168.0.1
An example of an IPv6 address is: 2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334
IPv4 has a limited number of addresses — around 4.3 billion.
IPv6 has virtually unlimited IP addresses.
IPv4 addresses are short and easy to remember.
IPv6 addresses are longer and harder to remember.
IPv4 is still widely used today.
IPv6 is slowly replacing IPv4 as the internet grows.
